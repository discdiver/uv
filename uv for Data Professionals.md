## What data professionals need to know about uv.

uv is all the rage. And with good reason. uv solves a slew of headaches and saves time. However, when I polled a class of data professionals, only a few of them had tried it.

As a data professional you can use uv to save time and money. Let's see how.

## Goals: reduce the pain of Python virtual environment management, slow package installs, and unreproducible environments

Python virtual environment management is a pain.

You've got your default Python version managers: venv, virtualenv.

Your snake-named virtual environment managers: conda, miniconda, mamba.

Your Python version managers: pyenv, tox.

Your Python package managers: pip, pipx, poetry.

And your package dependency version managers: requirements.txt and pyproject.toml and then you've got tools such as pipx to help you use them.

And thats a simplified list of the options. It ain't pretty.

The worst part is that when things go wrong and the wires get crossed, it's a time suck. I was reminded of this a few weeks ago. I've been a conda user for years (mamba flavor, lately). Recently, my `base` (default) conda environment had some deep package dependency issues that caused tough-to-diagnose problems. I wanted to remove my `base` environment and start fresh, but you can't easily do that, at least not without risking breaking your entire setup. But reinstalling conda yet again and risking a case of the malady known as "PATH issue-itis" isn't anyone's idea of a good time. So I went searching for alternatives.

uv brings simplicity and speed to the chaos that is Python virtual environment and package management.

## Goal: install uv so you can take advantage of its speed and simplicity

First, ensure you aren't already in a Python virtual environment. If you see parentheses around a word such as `(base)` in your terminal prompt, you probably are in a virtual environment. If it's a conda environment, exit it with `conda deactivate`. If it's a venv environment, exit it with `deactivate`. Run those commands until you don't see any parentheses in your prompt.

Check that you don't already have uv installed with:

```bash
uv --version
```

I'm using uv 0.5.25 (Homebrew 2025-01-28) for this example.

Install uv on a Mac or Linux machine with homebrew:

```bash
brew install uv
```

Alternatively, you can install uv with:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

On a Windows machine you can install uv with:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

For more assistance, see the [uv installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Let's use uv to speed up our work.

## Goal: create a Python virtual environment that will stick around for future use

The ux of uv is nice. It borrows from the syntax of popular tools.

If you've used `venv` before, you'll feel right at home, just preface your usual virtual environment creation command with `uv` and specify the desired Python version - no need to use a tool such as `pyenv` to install and manage Python versions.

Here's the command to create a virtual environment with Python 3.12:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

uv will find a Python 3.12 version locally if you have one installed. If you don't have a Python 3.12 version installed, uv will fetch and install the latest stable 3.12 version.

Then, follow the handy command line output instructions to activate your virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Viola! Your terminal prompt should display the name of a virtual environment in parentheses.

Let's install some Python packages.

## Goal: install packages really fast

uv is orders of magnitude faster than pip when it comes to installing packages into your virtual environment. And the syntax is familiar if you're used to installing packages with pip. For example, to install the `prefect` package, just throw `uv` in front of your usual pip command like this:

```bash
uv pip install prefect
```

You upgrade a package and its dependencies with the same `-U` flag that you'd use with pip:

```bash
uv pip install -U prefect
```

See the versions of all your installed packages with:

```bash
uv pip list
```

Now you've got a virtual environment and have installed packages into it. You build a useful project and everything works. Fantastic! Let's make this reproducible.

Just a heads up, that I've found one gotcha with uv. Inside the virtual environment, you can't see the packages installed in the global Python environment.

## Goal: make a reproducible environment

Let's install all the packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file with a single command.

```requirements.txt
polars
plotly
prefect 
```

As with pip, you can use the `-r` flag with uv to install all the packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the past, you might have used pip to specify top level package versions in your `requirements.txt` file.

```requirements.txt
prefect==3.11.0
polars==0.7.3
plotly==5.24.1
```

That's a step toward reproducibility, but sometimes a dependency of one of the packages you've specified will change and break your project. We don't want that, so let's create a lock file that specifies the exact versions of all top-level packages and their dependencies, all the way down.

uv can read a list of packages from one file and output a lock file that specifies the exact versions of all top-level packages and their dependencies - and their dependencies' dependencies, all the way down.

Let's specify the top level packages we need in  a `requirements.in` file. Then we'll generate a `requirements.txt` file with the versions of all specified packages and their dependencies with this command:

```bash
uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
```

Now our `requirements.txt` file contains the exact versions of all the top level packages and their dependencies, in tree format. When we run our `requirements.txt` install command, we'll get the exact versions of all the packages we want.

So what, you say? pipenv and poetry could do that, too? Fair enough, but let's talk about the need for speed.

## Goal: faster package installs in Docker

Faster package installs shorten feedback loops, increase developer productivity, and speed up CI/CD pipelines, saving time and money.

uv is written in the famously fast Rust language and takes advantage of clever optimizations to reduce package install times.

That's great for many development scenarios. But much of the world runs on Docker.

I saw over a 5x speedup by using uv vs. plain pip to install 17 Python packages in a Docker image build.
7 seconds vs. 37 seconds. ðŸ¤¯

How can we get the speed and simplicity of uv in a Docker image?

Just add:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=ghcr .io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/
```

And change:

```dockerfile
RUN pip install my_package
```

to:

```dockerfile
RUN uv pip install --system my_package
```

Or instead of making the change every time, just set the environment variable in your Dockerfile with:

```dockerfile
ENV UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON=1
```

## Goal: run a Python script in a single line in a disposable virtual environment with any needed packages

```bash
uv run my_script.py
```

Need a package such as polars?

```bash
uv run --with polars my_script.py
```

This is pretty neat!

For uv's next trick, let's fire up a Jupyter lab server in a disposable virtual environment with:

```bash
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```

I wish this was a thing when I was learning Python and teaching aspiring data scientists.

# Goal: run a file hosted on the web

If your file paths are set up correctly,uv will auto-install the dependencies for a script and run them in a temporary virtual environment.

```bash
uv run https://example.com/my_script.py
```

You can do the same thing with code in your clipboard on a Mac:

```bash
pbpaste | uv run - 
```

Both of the above examples were problematic for me because of PATH issues with old `uv` versions.

## Goal: project management

uv also solves pain points for project management. It helps you quickly start a project and provides handy commands for development.

```bash
uv init project1
```

This scaffolds a project with a `pyproject.toml` file, a `hello.py` file, and a `README.md` file.
It also adds`.git` and `.gitignore` files for version control.

You can declare your Python version as well as your dependencies and project metadata in `pyproject.toml`. This further helps with reproducibility.

Run the script in your project with:

```bash
uv run hello.py
```

Then uv automatically creates a virtual environment with a `.venv` file and creates a lock file with all pinned versions of your dependencies and their dependencies.  

Add and remove packages to your project like this:

```bash
uv add polars
uv remove polars
```

## Goal: publish your package

To build source distribution and wheel artifacts, make sure you have the necessary metadata in your `pyproject.toml` file and then run:

```bash
uv build
```

Then, you'll see `project1.egg-info` and `dist` directories in your project.

Once you've set up your PyPI credentials, you can publish your package to a PyPI-compatible index with:

```bash
uv publish
```

uv provides handy commands for working with your package.

## Conclusion

uv is the future and the present of Python virtual environment and package management.
